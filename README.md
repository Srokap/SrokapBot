TwitchBot
=========

This is just a basic Twitch chat bot I wrote for fun.

Installation
------------

Tested with [NodeJS 0.12.x](https://nodejs.org/), might work on earlier versions, but no promises.

Usage
-----

You need a Twitch account to be used use this bot script. You might want to make sure tht this account has proper
rights to post in chat and not hit rate limit (by responding too often in chat).

To obtain authentication token, you may use [Twitch Chat OAuth Password Generator](http://twitchapps.com/tmi/) that's
recommended by [Twitch for IRC access](http://help.twitch.tv/customer/portal/articles/1302780-twitch-irc)

Run by calling from command line:

	node index.js
